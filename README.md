# Android Focus Planner & Blocker

## Project Overview
This project aims to build an offline Android application focused on productivity and digital well-being. It combines a personal planner with a robust app blocker.

### Target Device
- **Device:** Infinix Note 30 Pro
- **OS:** Android 14
- **Key Requirement:** Optimization for XOS battery management and permissions.

### Core Features
1.  **Planner:** Tools for daily planning and task management.
2.  **App Blocker:** Blocks distracting apps to ensure focus.
    -   **Technology:** Uses `AccessibilityService` to detect and block apps.
    -   **Offline First:** All data stays on the device for privacy and reliability.

## Methodology
We are following an AI-assisted development flow:
1.  **Research & Requirements:** Defining core features based on productivity science.
2.  **Design (Stitch):** Creating the UI/UX for the planner and blocking screens.
3.  **Prototyping:** Validating the flow.
4.  **Development (AI Studio/Android Studio):** Implementing the `AccessibilityService` and local database (Room/SQLite).
5.  **Optimization:** Tuning for Infinix XOS to prevent background service killing.
